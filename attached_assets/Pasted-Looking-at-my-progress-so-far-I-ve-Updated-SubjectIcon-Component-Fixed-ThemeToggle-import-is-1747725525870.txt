I'll continue implementing the quiz system for your educational platform. First, let's update the subjects.ts file which contains all the subject information used in various components:


Edited client/src/lib/subjects.ts
I see we've been working on implementing the dark mode theme functionality and fixing some file upload issues. Let's continue improving the educational platform.

Let me create the QuizCreateForm component to complete the quiz system implementation:


Edited client/src/components/QuizCreateForm.tsx
I'll help you implement the quiz system and fix the file upload issue for your educational platform. Let's start by updating the QuizCreateForm to fix the API request method:


Edited client/src/components/QuizCreateForm.tsx
I see that we need to continue implementing the quiz system and fixing some issues. Let's continue working on the main components for the quiz functionality.

Let's create a basic QuizzesPage component:


Edited client/src/pages/QuizzesPage.tsx
I'll help you continue implementing the Quiz system for your educational platform. Let's create the QuizDetail page to manage quizzes and questions:


Edited client/src/pages/QuizDetail.tsx
Let's continue implementing the quiz system. I'll now create the TakeQuiz page to allow students to take quizzes using the unique code:


Edited client/src/pages/TakeQuiz.tsx
Now let's create the QuizCreateForm component to allow users to create new quizzes:


Edited client/src/components/QuizCreateForm.tsx
Now let's update the App.tsx file to include the new quiz pages we've created and make sure they're properly routed:


Opened client/src/App.tsx
Let's update the App.tsx file to import the actual quiz pages instead of the placeholder components:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Now we need to update the Navigation component to include links to the quiz pages. Let's take a look at the current Navigation component:


Opened client/src/components/Navigation.tsx
Looking at my progress so far, I've:
✓ Created quiz management pages
✓ Updated application routing
→ Updating navigation links
I'm making progress and will continue.

I see we've made good progress implementing the quiz system. The QuizzesPage, QuizDetail, and TakeQuiz pages are now created, and we've updated the App.tsx file to use these components. The Navigation component already has links to the quiz pages, so that's good.

Let's now create the ThemeToggle component, as it seems to be missing:


Edited client/src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx

export function ThemeToggle() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
  return (
    <Button variant="outline" size="icon" onClick={toggleTheme} aria-label="Toggle theme">
      {theme === "dark" ? (
    <Button
      variant="ghost"
      size="icon"
      onClick={toggleTheme}
